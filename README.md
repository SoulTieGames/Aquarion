# Aquarion
EZ-Flash Omega Custom theme.
This theme is based on both the open source EZ_-Flash FW, and 
Sterophonick's simpleLight theme (https://github.com/Sterophonick/SimpleLight). Kudos!
All the features of simpleLight are included with this release, along with added features (menu music, additional options, etc).

# 

Aquarion gives you the option to skip the boot menu entirely,
and boot with either CLEAN or ADDON options. To change the settings, press SELECT.
With the options menu open, you can press the left or right triggers to change pages
and edit sound/music settings. 

I think the color scheme/new images are pleasing. The background music comes from CCO files that I've had on my PC for ages,
if anyone knows who authored the tracks please let me know so that I can credit them. Enjoy!

# To install:
Just unzip to the root of your SD and hold the right trigger while booting up your GBA. 
Easy peasy.

I was planning on adding more to this, but I've been busy with other projects.
